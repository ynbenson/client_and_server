This is a README for server side. 

The server code will take in <port_number> and <secret_key> as its argument.

The server side will always check if the secret key provided will match the secret_key that has been passed as a argument. It they don't match, then server and client will shut down. 

In the case where the secret_key matches, it will perform whatever the request that client has sent, when the request is either one of cput, cget, cdelete, clist, and quit.

When cput is provided with valid filename, server will receive the file from client.
When cget is provided with valid filename, server will transmit the file to client.
When cdelete is provided with valie filename, server will delete the file from current directory. 
When clist is provided, server will transmit the filename of current directory one at a time to client.
Finally when quit is entered, the server will shut down.
