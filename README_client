This is a README page for client code.

The client code will take in <hostname> <port_number> and <secret_key> as its argument.

Every time the user enters a valid command (cput, cget, cdelete, clist, quit) with correct argument and argument count, the type of request and secret key will be sent to the server side. 

If the secret_key provided matches the key of server side, it will do what it was requested, and then sends back a feedback response of 0 to a client, -1 if something goes wrong. 

If the secret_key provided does not match the client and server side will automatically shut down.

The client will keep running until user enters quit or hit CTRL+D.

There are several assumptions and here's the list of them.
(1)File name must not be more than 80 characters long.
(2)File content size will not be greater than 100KB.
(3)File name can be any ASCII characater expect \0.
(4)Secret key will be 4byte unsigned int.
